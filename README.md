This was a project for building a new website and getting comfortable using react.

We mostly paid attention to the folder structure, a custom hook and useContext for a bit of global state.

There were a few missed opportunities to componentize more of the project. Due to the simplicity of the design, these opportunities were skipped.

# Comparison of React/Github-pages and Springboot/Digital Ocean

![Comparison](design/comparo.PNG)
Above is a comparison between the older springboot powered website on the right and the newer React and github pages site on the left.

The biggest impact of going serverless is the cost reduction and reduced complexity. The cost of operating the Digital Ocean share VPS droplet was removed. The complexity of using springboot to render and serve the pages was also removed.

Todos: Tablet, mobile and extra large styling.
